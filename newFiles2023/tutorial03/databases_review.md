# Databases
Review: https://github.com/veerdonk/data_processing/blob/master/Snakefile

1. How is the input construction handled in case of a database?
2. How is the snakefile documented
3. What would you improve in this script?

The answers to the questions follow now:
1. blabla
2. Documentation is done with use of the message: command and using comments that start with #
3. I'd split up the main Snakefile into multiple sub-units. For example, the plotresults could be in a statistics.smk.
